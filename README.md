SSH Port Forwarding Worm

![shai-hulu](https://github.com/CanIBuyYouAHat/Shai-Hulud/blob/main/shaihulud.png?raw=true)

Named after the Great Sandworm of Arrakis, this SSH Port Forwarding Worm explores a network in search of Spice, establishing its territory by setting up port forwarding along the way. 

Built originally as an exercise for class, Shai-Hulud will continue to evolve and adapt to any arid network it encounters. 
Shai-Hulud explores the network underground, glimpsing information from landmarks and learning the lay of the land.
