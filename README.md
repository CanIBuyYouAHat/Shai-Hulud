# Shai-Hulud
SSH Port Forwarding Worm

Named after the Great Sandworm of Arrakis, this SSH Port Forwarding Worm explores a network in search of Spice, establishing its territory by setting up port forwarding along the way. 

Built originally as an exercise for class, Shai-Hulud will continue to evolve and adapt to any arid network it encounters.
